# A command-line script for incrementing build numbers for all known targets in an Xcode project.
#
# This script has two main goals: firstly, to ensure that all the targets in a project have the
# same CFBundleVersion and CFBundleShortVersionString values. This is because mismatched values
# can cause a warning when submitting to the App Store.
#
# Secondly, the script ensures that the build number is incremented when changes are declared
# based on git's records. Alternatively the number of commits can be used, and is toggled by using
# the argument "--reflect-commits". If not on "master", the current branch name will be used to
# ensure no version collisions across branches.
#
# If not using git, you are a braver soul than I.

# The xcodeproj. This is usually found by the script, but you may need to specify its location
# if it's not in the same folder as the script is called from (the project root if called as a
# build phase run script).
#
#xcodeproj="Project.xcodeproj"

##
# We have to define an Info.plist as the source of truth. This is typically the one for the main
# target. If not set, the script will try to guess the correct file from the list it gathers from
# the xcodeproj file, but this can be overriden by setting the path here.
#
#plist="Project/Info.plist"

# We use PlistBuddy to handle the Info.plist values. Here we define where it lives.
